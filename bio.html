            <h2>BIO</h2>
            <p>Born in the suburbs of Memphis, Tennessee in 1980, Joseph Camp spent much of his childhood playing sports, building bike ramps and keeping up with his two older brothers. This keeping up, led to an independent spirit and the ability to create innovative solutions. Camp gets much of his natural work ethic from his father, a retired railroad engineer. His mother provided much of his creative influence. Throughout his life, he had mentors that helped refine these skills. He uses his work as a means of sharing personal experiences of life. His memories of travels to Italy form a basis for his inventive approach to painting.</p>
